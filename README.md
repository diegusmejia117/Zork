# Zork
Hi my name is Diego Mejia, i am a sophomore Game Designer and this is my coding entrance exam.
This exam consists in creating a console game using Zork as an inspiration.

In my case i made a Detective inspired game, where you need to look for clues to resolve a mystery in the mansion you are in.

In my development time i faced many challenges, specially coding using only a console, this was hard for me because i am proficient in C++ and C# programming directly in game engines like Unreal and Unity.

Not having a visual representation of what i wanted to do was something quite hard to get by.

Also using vectors, arrays, textPrints, and other functions we quite different form their use in combination with Unreal libraries.

this made making the inventory sistem and the "place inside" subsystem quite challenging.

in the end i think i got a fun little game to enjoy, but i acknowledge that i still have much to learn to code better and faster.

on the other side, i liked the challenge it reminded me why i like to code.(i have being working as an Unity integrator since i graduated from university)

Thank you for your time.

Hope you enjoy Nocturnal(i know it needs a better name, hehe).
